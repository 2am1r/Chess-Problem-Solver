	A FEN "record" defines a particular game position, all in one text 
	line and using only the ASCII character set. A FEN record contains 
	six fields. The fields are:

	Piece placement (from White's perspective). Each rank is described,
	starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1; within each rank, the 
	contents of each square are described from file "a" through  "h". 
	Following the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), each piece is 
	identified by a single letter taken from the standard English names 
	(pawn = "P", knight = "N", bishop = "B", rook = "R", queen = "Q" and 
	king = "K"). White pieces are designated using upper-case letters 
	("PNBRQK") while black pieces use lowercase ("pnbrqk").  Empty 
	squares are noted using digits 1 through 8 (the umber of empty 
	squares), and "/" separates ranks.
	
	Char "w" means White moves next, "b" means Black moves next.
	
	Castling availability. If neither side can castle, this is "-". 
	Otherwise, this has one or more letters: "K" (White can castle 
	kingside), "Q" (White can castle queenside), "k" (Black can castle 
	kingside), and/or "q" (Black can castle queenside). A move that 
	temporarily prevents castling does not negate this notation.
	
	En passant target square in algebraic notation. If there's no en 
	passant target square, this is "-". If a pawn has just made a 
	two-square move, this is the position "behind" the pawn. This is 
	recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to make an
	 en passant capture.
	
	Halfmove clock: This is the number of halfmoves since the last capture 
	or pawn advance. This is used to determine if a draw can be claimed 
	under the fifty-move rule.
	
	Fullmove number: The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is 
	incremented after Black's move.
